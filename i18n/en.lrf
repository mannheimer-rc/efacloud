|<li>Users have a numeric efaCludUserID which is used for
|login on the server. Example: efaCloudUserID '1142'
|for 'Alex Admin'. It is set with the option: 'Change profile'</li>
|<li>The permissions for efaCloud users are set with roles. The possible roles are: admin = (administrator) can change everything, especially user data; board = (board) can see everything, but cannot change user data; bths = (boathouse) can change what a boathouse PC must be able to change; member = (member), not yet defined; anonymous = (anonymous) no rights.</li>
|<li>The efaCloud users can also have an efa admin permission
|assigned to them, their rights are then set in the server in the same way as in the
|efa PC and affect all efa PCs that are
|connected to the server. For this purpose an
|efa admin name is assigned to the efaCloud user. This can be used for the admin login in the

|<p>Extra fields for simplified import:</p>
|<ol>
|<li>StatusName: The allowed values for StatusName are those given as names in
|efa2status, e.g. "Guest" (without the
|quotes). The value is then replaced by the Id and written into
|the StatusId field.</li>
|<li>ValidFromDate, InvalidFromDate: instead of the hard-to-read
|Unix timestamp, a date in the format DD.MM.YYYY can
