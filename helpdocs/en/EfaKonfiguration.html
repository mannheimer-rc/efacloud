<h3>Efa configuration</h3>
<p>The configuration of the efa-PCs (= clients) has an impact on
	representation and data validity. Unlike the data, the configuration
	cannot be synchronised across all connected clients connected clients,
	because it is quite possible that different efa different efa-PCs use
	different configurations, for example because they operate different
	logbooks.</p>
<p>efaCloud therefore creates the set of known logbooks and the of
	the known logbooks and the known club logbooks. Only in this way can be
	checked whether a trip belongs in a certain logbook at all, for example
	a certain logbook, for example.</p>
<p>For the confgured look-up lists (BOAT, TYPE, NUMSEATS etc). it is
	strongly recommended to provide all connected efa-clients clients with
	the same value lists, otherwise changes may occur because efa has
	because efa replaces an unknown look-up value with the default value.
	default value. Creating "totals look-up lists" does not help here.
	Instead, each PC that is connected must use the same lists here. must
	use the same lists.</p>
<p>Something similar also applies to a few configuration values, for
	example, the name format (first name last name or last name, First
	Name). If different settings are used, a name may a name may no longer
	be recognised.</p>
