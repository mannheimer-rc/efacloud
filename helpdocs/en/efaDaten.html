<h3>efa data</h3>
<p>The PC programme efa holds all data in 17 tables with a total of
	491 data fields. total of 491 data fields.</p>
<h4>Tables</h4>
<p>Four tables in efa are "versioned", i.e. they contain objects
	with several data records, each with a validity period. have a validity
	period. In ten of the 17 tables, an object ID (UUID) serves as the key
	to the data record or - for the versioned tables - to the object.</p>
<p>Three tables are dependent on the boot table: Boot status - there
	there is exactly one data set per boat, boat damage and reservations,
	which, in addition to the counter, also have the object ID (UUID) of
	the boat as key, so that a reservation number can occur more than once,
	but this does not usually happen. usually does not happen.</p>

<h4>Validity rules</h4>
<p>In addition to the uniqueness of the keys, there are other
	Validity rules that are applied to records. If they are violated, efa
	cannot save the record. Therefore these rules must also be checked in
	efaCloud. If the check is not done in exactly the same way, the
	situation can occur that records between efa-PC and efaCloud server do
	not become synchronous.</p>
<h4>Edit data</h4>
<p>Editing data in efaCloud is possible but not yet recommended. not
	yet recommended. The reason is the still incomplete implementation of
	the implementation of the validity check in efaCloud - synchronisation
	problems could synchronisation problems after editing.</p>
