<h3>Database audit</h3>
<p>EfaCloud uses a database in which, in addition to the efa data
	efaCloud user data, change tracking and archive. are present. The efa
	data is synchronised with one or more efa PCs on a more or less regular
	basis. efa PCs on a more or less regular basis. In the PCs, validations
	and automatic audits take place in the PCs, which change the data. This
	is how inconsistencies inconsistencies in the data.</p>
>
<p>The audit serves to find these inconsistencies, to sift them out
	and rectify them.</p>
<h4>Configuration audit</h4>
.
<p>The layout of the tables is checked and compared with the layout
	expected for expected for the current version. Any deviations are
	indicated.</p>
<p>If there are deviations, the option of correction is offered and
	recommended.</p>
<h4>Records without ecrid identification</h4>
<p>At the end of 2021, efaCloud introduced the efaCloud Record Id =
	ecrid which makes records identifiable with exactly one key. efa as a
	PC program uses combined keys, such as the Id of a person and the the
	id of a person and the validity period to identify a record. identify a
	record.</p>
<p>When upgrading from version &lt; 2.3.0_12, there may still be
	records without an records without ecrid identification, which must be
	corrected immediately and may and may take some time to correct.</p>
<p>
<h4>Corrupt records, missing information</h4>
<p>Data records are checked for completeness. If values are missing
	in data fields, the errors are indicated. A corrupt record is one that
	is missing technically relevant information</p>
.
<p>From previous versions, in which errors were in the deletion
	routine, there are empty data records in which the entry for the type
	of last change was type of the last change was also deleted, so that
	the deletion process is is stopped. These records are corrected
	peu-Ã -peu.</p>
<p>An otherwise corrupt record should be examined and corrected.
	corrected. If information is missing that is relevant to the content,
	the synchronisation with an efa-PC is impossible, the problem will be
	shown under missing information. Such data records can often still be
	corrected.</p>
<h4>Duplicates</h4>
<p>In efa there are tables in which names or the like in addition
	should be unique in addition to the record key, but this uniqueness is
	not uniqueness is not enforced. For example, if for a person name or a
	destination, more than one object id exists, because the person or
	destination has been created more than once, this will be displayed.
	This can distort evaluations. Cleaning up duplicates is only possible
	in efa, not in efaCloud. There is the function 'Merge' to accomplish
	this.</p>
<p>
<h4>Virtual data fields</h4>
<p>
	Efa uses so-called "virtual" data fields to speed up displays, for
	example the for example the data field "AllCrewNames" with all team
	names that would names of the team, which would otherwise have to be
	determined by looking up from the ids. These fields are set when the
	record is set. If, for instance, names are changed or names become Ids
	because a new member has been added in the meantime, errors can occur
	in the virtual fields. Via a database audit (efa_daten &gt; audit
	database), these errors can be errors are corrected. This is always
	done automatically because they do not information.<br>Strictly
	speaking, for reasons of data protection data protection reasons, it is
	even necessary after archiving a data record to even necessary to
	correct the name to archivID:xxx, because these virtual these virtual
	data fields may still contain names that have already been archived.
	already archived names.
