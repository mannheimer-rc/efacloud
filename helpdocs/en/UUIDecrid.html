<h3>Ecrid and Object ID (UUID)</h3>
<p>Efa uses so-called "keys" to find records uniquely. find. Two
	keys play a special role:</p>
<ul>
	<li>UUID = Universally Unique Identifier for many objects, like
		boats or such as boats or people, in efa. These objects sometimes have
		have several versions with delimited periods of validity, in which
		case the the validity period must also be specified in addition to the
		object ID. validity period must also be specified. In its normal form,
		a UUID looks like this: '550e8400-e29b-11d4-a716-446655440000', They
		are randomly generated as a 128-bit number and are therefore unique
		worldwide. unique. 4 bits are encoded per row, the '-'s are of no
		meaning.</li>
	<li>ecrid = efacloud record ID. This key uniquely references
		uniquely references a record, for example, a personal record in a
		specific validity period or a trip in a specific logbook. specific
		logbook. The key is also randomly generated as a 72-bit number, so
		that global uniqueness can also be assumed for the ecrid key.
		uniqueness can be assumed for the ecrid key. An example is
		'5wVSJezbhzro'. 6 bits are encoded per character.</li>
