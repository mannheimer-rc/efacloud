<h3>Synchronisation</h3>
<p>There is a regular data exchange between the efa PCs and the
	efaCloud server. exchange takes place regularly to keep the data
	consistent. consistent. This is because each efa-PC keeps a copy of the
	data, so that it can continue to continues to run even if the internet
	goes down.</p>
<p>There are two directions: upload = sending the data from the PC
	to the efaCloud server and download = fetching the data from the
	efaCloud server. by the efa PC. The efa-PC is always active, the
	efaCloud server only only reacts.</p>
<h4>Synchronisation at programme start on efa-PC</h4>
.
<p>If efa is started on an efa-PC and efaCloud is activated as the
	project project storage, a download synchronization takes place
	immediately. download synchronization takes place immediately.</p>
<h4>Automatic download synchronisation</h4>
<p>Because several PCs can be connected to one efaCloud server, data
	on the server can data on the server can change without any efa PC
	being aware of it. efa-PC is aware of this. For this reason, new data
	is regularly regularly. The interval between two automatic download
	synchronisations is one hour by default.
<h4>Automatic change check</h4>
<p>Most of the time, nothing changes in the data. That is why there
	is possibility to ask when the last write activity of data in the
	efaCloud data was in the efaCloud server. This change check is a very
	query and does not require any authorisation, because it only only
	provides information on whether anyone has changed any has changed any
	data. The interval between two automatic change checks is one minute by
	default. If a change is is reported, it triggers a synchronisation in
	the efa-PC.</p>
<h4>Automatic upload synchronisation</h4>
<p>An efa-PC that changes data locally also writes this change to
	the efaCloud. to the efaCloud database. If this always works, there is
	no need for no upload synchronisation. However, because there are
	always interruptions in the operation, a daily upload synchronisation
	is synchronisation is used to reload changes that have not been
	transferred from the from the efa-PC to the efaCloud server.
<p>The upload synchronisation takes place in the efa-PC once a day
	in in connection with the first download synchronisation of the day. It
	can also be triggered by an automatic process in efa-PC. can be
	triggered.</p>
