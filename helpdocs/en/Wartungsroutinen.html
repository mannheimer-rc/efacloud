<h3>Daily maintenance routines and automatic processes</h3>
.
<p>A web server such as the efaCloud server does not usually have
	the not have the possibility to initiate control activities. However,
	there are automatic processes.</p>
<h4>Triggers</h4>
<p>But because the efaCloud server can be assumed to be accessed
	regularly the efaCloud server, the first authorised access of the day
	can be used of the day can be used to trigger the rule activities.
<p>Ideally, the trigger is an efa-PC that restarts during the night
	and therefore and reauthorises itself on the efaCloud server.
	Alternatively it is the first efaCloud user to log in.</p>
<p>Because of the maintenance routing, the efaCloud server is not
	available.
<p>Because the maintenance routines take time, the first access a
	day is first access a day is significantly delayed, depending on the
	size of the database. up to 30 seconds.</p>
<p>
<h4>Maintenance routines</h4>
<p>As a regular maintenance routine, the data are checked daily for
	consistency and corrected where automatically possible. Log files are
	cleaned up. Archiving of data that is now due is carried out. The
	Access statistics are evaluated and the size of the database is
	recorded. The result is saved as audit.log and can be sent with support
	requests. support enquiries.</p>
>
<h4>automatic processes</h4>
<p>At present, there are two workflows that can be configured so
	that so that on some days they are triggered together with the
	maintenance work.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Send personal logbook to each person in efa2persons, for whom
		a mail address is entered and who has one or more current logbook has
		one or more journeys,</li>
	<li>Send application monitoring rule report to the address, which
		is entered as the copy recipient of workflow notifications.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Setting</h4>
<p>For each automatic workflow, one line is entered in the text
	field. is entered. The syntax is:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Day specification = D or W or M for daily, weekly, monthly and
		a number. Examples D1 = daily, W1 = Mondays, M1 =. First of the month,
		M31 = Last of the month.</li>
	<li>Job options: 'persLogbook' = sending the personal logbook to
		all persons who have deposited an e-mail address in efa2persons. email
		address in efa2persons or 'monitoring' = sending the regular
		monitoring to all efaCloudUser with the role 'admin'.</li>
</ol>
<p>in job per flow, as 'tag specification type' e.g. 'M31
	persLogbook'.</p>
<h4>Test</h4>
<p>The maintenance routines can also be started manually for
	testing. for testing under 'Set efaCloud > Run maintenance routines'.
	The automatic routines will not be carried out in this way.</p>
<p>You can send the personal logbook to yourself under 'efa Settings
	> Test personal logbook'</p>
<p>The personal logbook can be sent to you under 'efaCloud settings
	> Test personal logbook'.
