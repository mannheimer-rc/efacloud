<h4>Duplicates</h4>
<p>In efa there are tables in which names or similar should be unique in addition
	should be unique in addition to the key of the record, but this
	uniqueness is not enforced. For example, if for a
	person name or a destination, more than one object id exists,
	because the person or destination has been created more than once, this will be
	displayed. This can distort evaluations. Cleaning up duplicates
	is only possible in efa, not in efaCloud. There is the
	function 'Merge' to accomplish this.</p>
