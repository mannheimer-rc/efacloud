	<h1>Technical safety</h1>
	<h2>Technical structure</h2>
	<p>The application consists of an executable PHP script, which
		accesses accesses a MySQL database, and a file system for code storage
		Code storage, configuration and monitoring.</p>
	<p>The file system is not externally readable except for selected
		directories. externally readable. Only the directories that are
		accessed directly via browser or accessed directly via browser or API:
		api, forms, js, license, pages, public, resources.</p>
	<p>All other directories are readable both through authorization
		assignment, as well as by depositing a .htaccess file. file for access
		from the outside.</p>
	<p>
		<span lang="en-UK">The application uses besides the standard
			modu</span><span lang="en-UK">l</span><span lang="en-UK">en of PHP no
			framework.</span>
	</p>
	<h3>Database security</h3>
	<p>The technical user used to access the application's Database is
		stored in the configuration. This Configuration is located in the
		inaccessible area of the file directory and is not stored in plain
		text, but is additionally "hidden" by simple symmetrical scrambling
		and subsequent subsequent base64 encoding. This does not protect
		against real hackers, but it requires an access to the protected
		server area and is thus secured.</p>
	<h3>Load limiting</h3>
	<p>The application has a built-in load limiter that limits max.
		{#max_inits_per_hour#} accesses or API containers and max.
		{#max_errors_per_hour#} errors per hour on both the PHP application
		and the API. After that, any access or API container rejected.</p>
	<h2>Application access</h2>
	<p>
		<span lang="en-UK">The API and the PHP application encapsulate
			all database accesses, so direct SQL statements by the user are are
			not possible. </span><span lang="en-UK">On the API, up to. up to ten

	</p>
	<h3>efaWeb</h3>
	<p>efaWeb provides a Javascript application within the efaCloud
		server offering. It is accessed via the pages/bths.php page. page. The
		javascript parts are completely located in the directory js (see
		above).</p>
	<p>efaWeb does not access the data directly, but via the API, just
		like the data, just like the boathouse PC does. There is no direct
		access from the efaWeb logbook application to the database.</p>
	<p>Users of efaWeb are identified and authorized via the API.
		authorized through the API, where the bths.php page, when a session is
		open the current user to efaWeb, who does not need to authorize
		himself again. need to authorize.</p>
	<h3>Authorization concept</h3>
	<p>The efaCloud application distinguishes six roles, those marked
		with *. marked are privileged roles, for which the Authorizations are
		listed by name below. Each role has basically all permissions of the
		role listed before:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>anonymous</b>: the user who is not logged in.</li>
		<li><b>guest</b>: guest access for testing purposes</li>
		<li><b>member</b>: club members, access to own profile. to check
			the data stored in the club</li>
		<li><b>*bths</b>: Boathouse PC to enter trips, Damage reports,
			messages to Admin etc.</li>
		<li><b>*board</b><span style="font-weight: normal">: </span><span
			style="font-weight: normal">Board functions</span></li>
		<li><b>*admin</b><span style="font-weight: normal">: </span><span
			style="font-weight: normal">Application administrator</span></li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<b>The permissions on the web are:</b>
	</p>
	<p>{#accessibleWebPerRole#}</p>
	<p>
		<b>The permissions on the API interface are:</b>
	</p>
	<p>{#accessableAPIperRole#}</p>
	<p>The admin permission profiles used in efa are stored in efaCloud
		to ensure consistency across all clients through centralized
		Administration, but without effect. An admin access is always checked
		online, i.e. a boathouse PC that is offline, can only be be managed by
		the local efa superadmin.</p>
	<h2>Monitoring</h2>

	<p>The application includes extensive monitoring logic as well as.
		the possibility of auditing.</p>
	<h3>Logs</h3>
	<p>Every transaction on the API, every login, every error and every
		data change, and every list deployment is logged. However, the
		corresponding logs are only accessible to users in the role of 'admin'
		role, as it also contains, in particular, in the data change log
		contains real data.</p>
	<p>Users with an administrative privilege must be that their
		activity can be recorded and assigned.</p>
	<p>The log is only accessible to users in the 'admin' role. can be
		assigned.</p>
	<h3>Audit, cronjobs</h3>

	<p>The application performs periodic "audits" during which the
		authorization structure in the file directory and corrects it if
		necessary.</p>
	<h3>Audit, cron jobs is made.</h3>
	<p>Cron jobs are used for database control and allow the Dispatch
		of logbooks to members.</p>
	<h2>Interfaces, export and import of data</h2>

	<p>All accesses are executed via HTTPS. Only during the
		installation, a one-time sftp access is required to store the
		installation file Installation file in the root directory. Upgrades
		also use HTTPS access to the efaCloud server.</p>
	<p>Data can be exported as lists via the API as well as via the
		User application to be exported as lists. The export via the API is
		required for the synchronization of the boathouse PCs with the server.
		The export as a list in the server application is for administrative
		purposes - it is written along with the exporting user and and
		requires the permission level "board".</p>
	<p>Data can be imported as lists via the API as well as via the
		User application to be imported as lists. Importing via the API is
		required for the synchronization of the boathouse PCs with the server.
		Exporting as a list in the server application is used for Restoring
		backups and require 'admin' privileges.</p>
	<h1>Procedures</h1>

	<p>In order to adequately ensure data protection. the following
		procedures for granting and verifying permissions. agreed.</p>
	<h2>Authorization allocation</h2>
	<p>Permissions will be assigned by a user with the the
		authorization "admin" after checking the function of the user in the
		club. The authorization "board" is thereby assigned only to function
		holders in the Association.</p>
	<h2>Removal of authorization</h2>

	<p>The authorization "board" or "admin" will be withdrawn in the
		event that the Association function from by a user with the
		authorization "admin" to "member". The user is set to the "anonymous"
		permission level when the user leaves the association set to the
		authorization level "anonymous".</p>
	<h2>Permission control</h2>

	<p>Once a year, the permissions are checked by the operator of the
		of the application.</p>
	<h2>Deletion concept</h2>
	<p>An automated deletion or anonymization of the data does not take
		place.</p>
	<h2>Process control</h2>
	<p>Once a year, this security concept will be updated and submitted
		the association's board of directors and the data protection officer
		for and the data protection officer for information and control of
		appropriate implementation of the application.</p>
	<h1>Audit</h1>
	<p>The following is a summary of the current Access Status and the
		current audit result is provided. Variable Information always refers
		to the last 14 days, thus represents therefore only represent a random
		sample.</p>
	<p>With regard to the data sets, it should be noted that versioned
		tables. (efa2boats, efa2destinations, efa2groups, efa2persons) usually
		contain more data contain more records than objects, because an object
		like the for example the person has several records with different
		temporal validity.</p>
	<p>This monitoring information is also available to the
		administrator available online.</p>
	<h2>Access statistics</h2>
	<h3>Accesses over the last 14 days via the web</h3>

	<p>The access type is login, init (= page views), and error.
		(generated redirects to the error.php error page) are distinguished.</p>
	<p>{#ZugriffeWeb#}</p>
	<h3>Accesses in the last 14 days via the API</h3>

	<span>{#ZugriffeAPI#}</span>
	<h3>Data changes in the last 14 days</h3>
	<p>{#ChangesAll#}</p>
	<h2>Named users</h2>
	<p>Users with special rights are listed by name here for the
		control of the security concept by the club board.</p>
	<h3>Privileged users</h3>
	<p>The users with privileged roles are:</p>
	<p>{#privilegierteNutzer#}</p>
	<h3>Users with efa admin privileges</h3>

	<p>The users with efa-Admin rights are:</p>
	<p>{#efaAdminNutzer#}</p>
	<h2>Configuration overview</h2>
	<p>Somewhat less technical than the audit log is the Compilation of
		parameters that are configured by the administrator.</p>
	<p>{#configuration#}</p>
	<h2>Current Daily Audit</h2>

	<p>On a daily basis, efaCloud records the status in the form of an
		audit. At creation of the concept, an audit was performed, the result
		of which is is printed here as well.</p>
